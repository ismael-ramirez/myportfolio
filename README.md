This is my professional portfolio website. This website gives samples of my previous work. My portfolio contains my name, a recent phonto, and links to sections about me, also my work, and how to contact me. When you click on any of the links in the navigation then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When presented with my first web project application in the work section of my portfolio, that image will be larger in size than the others. Also when clicking on some of the images of the application you will be redirected to some of the deployed applications. When resizing the page or viewing the site on various screens than you will mostly be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
